11,5,2,1,5,tingle-tongued pleasant finish round and grainy i am so happy after previous i almost never want to drink whiskey again

13,4.8,2,4,5,spicy! this whiskey wants to be your friend but only after it's known you for a while rye?
14,4.2,2,3,4,mild spice makes its own booziness with sweet grain this whiskey is resigned to failing life's trials and tribulations but at least it got better grades than you in high school
